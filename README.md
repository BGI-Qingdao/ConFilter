## if you want to use K40->randstrobe(2,10,10,30) as marker (recommended)

see [pipelines/s40_pipeline/](https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/Symbiont-Screener/tree/master/pipelines/s40_pipeline) 

what is strobemer ? see https://github.com/ksahlin/strobemers and https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/strobemer_cpptest

## if you want to use K21 as marker ( implemented for compare to strobemer, no longer maintaining )
